# Task1. "Temperature Converter"
#  Write a Python program that prompts the user to enter a temperature in Celsius and then
#  converts it to Fahrenheit using the formula: F = (C * 9/5) + 32. Your program should then
#  print out the converted temperature in Fahrenheit.
#  However, if the user enters a temperature below-273.15°C (the lowest possible
#  temperature in the universe, also known as absolute zero), your program should print an
#  error message instead of attempting to convert the temperature.
#  Note: You can assume that the user will enter a valid input (a number for the temperature in Celsius).
#  Example output:
#  Enter the temperature in Celsius: 25
#  25°C is equivalent to 77°F
#  Example output (if the user enters a temperature below absolute zero):
#  Enter the temperature in Celsius:-300
#  Error: Temperature below absolute zero (-273.15°C)

cls = float(input("Hello! Enter the temperature in Celsius: "))
if cls < -273.15:
      print ("Temperature below absolute zero (-273.15°C)!!!")
else:
        fht = (cls * 9/5) + 32
        print(cls, "°C is equivalent to ", fht, "°F")
